Here we use `DifferentialEquations` to solve the heat diffusion transient problem.

Since this is a very heavy dependency, this folder has its own environment. Please activate and instantiate.

Then run one of the three examples, differential equations solution, differential equations with the mass matrix, and ad-hoc generalized trapezoidal method solution.
